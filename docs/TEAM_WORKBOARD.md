# Team Workboard

This is the single source of truth for active project work. Update this file before
starting a task and again when its state changes. `TEAM_STATUS.md` records broader
milestones; this file prevents two members from editing the same area at the same time.

Last remote audit: 20 September 2026 by Ayush. Palak's evaluation pipeline was reviewed
and merged through [PR #3](https://github.com/AyushPatra45/AI-DeepFake-Detector/pull/3).
Ayush's retention and resource-limit work was reviewed and merged through
[PR #4](https://github.com/AyushPatra45/AI-DeepFake-Detector/pull/4). Palak's evaluator
integration tests were reviewed and merged through
[PR #5](https://github.com/AyushPatra45/AI-DeepFake-Detector/pull/5), and her deepfake
failure and batch-inference tests were reviewed and merged through
[PR #6](https://github.com/AyushPatra45/AI-DeepFake-Detector/pull/6).
Ayush's reproducible synthetic demonstration corpus and repository CI were reviewed
and merged through [PR #8](https://github.com/AyushPatra45/AI-DeepFake-Detector/pull/8).
Ayana's deterministic steganography evaluation was independently verified, approved,
and merged through [PR #9](https://github.com/AyushPatra45/AI-DeepFake-Detector/pull/9).
Ayana's controlled ELA evaluation was reproduced, reviewed, and merged through
[PR #11](https://github.com/AyushPatra45/AI-DeepFake-Detector/pull/11).
Ayana's initial Y-03 accessibility corrections were completed by Ayush with Codex
assistance, verified in a live browser, and merged at commit `3e5276a`.

## Status values

- `READY`: available for a member to claim.
- `CLAIMED`: owner and branch are recorded; implementation has not started.
- `IN_PROGRESS`: code, experiments, tests, or documentation are being produced.
- `BLOCKED`: progress needs a decision, dependency, dataset, or another hand-off.
- `PR_OPEN`: branch is pushed and a pull request is ready for review.
- `MERGED`: reviewed work is present on `main`.

Assignment is not authorship. The `Implemented / committed by` column must match the
actual work and Git history.

## Collision-prevention procedure

1. Run `git switch main`, `git pull --ff-only origin main`, and `git fetch --prune`.
2. Read this file and choose one `READY` task assigned to you.
3. Confirm that nobody owns the same files or area in an active row.
4. Change the row to `CLAIMED` and add your intended implementation branch and files.
   Land this coordination-only edit on `main` through the GitHub editor or a tiny claim
   pull request before writing implementation code.
5. Pull the claimed row from `main`, then create the implementation branch recorded in
   the row. Never implement directly on `main`.
6. Change the row to `IN_PROGRESS` in the implementation branch when work begins.
7. Before editing a shared file such as `README.md`, `pyproject.toml`, API schemas, or
   report formats, record it in the row and notify the other owners.
8. Commit in small units and push at least at the end of each work session.
9. When opening a pull request, change the status to `PR_OPEN` and add its link.
10. After merge, move the factual result to the completed table and select the next
    `READY` task.

Do not overwrite another member's branch, force-push shared work, or mark work
`MERGED` before it is present on `origin/main`.

## Handoff checklist

- Branch is pushed and visible on GitHub.
- Pull request explains the task ID, changed files, approach, and limitations.
- Tests or experiment commands and their actual results are recorded.
- Generated datasets, uploads, checkpoints, secrets, and large artifacts are not in Git.
- Documentation states what is complete and what remains unvalidated.
- Another teammate can run, review, and explain the work.
